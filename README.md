# 2d-game-engine
A 2D game engine using software rendering.

The initial idea I had for this project: my main, if a bit ambitious, goal is to make an Elite style
game with a procedural-generation "galaxy" of stars with planets and moons and stuff. I have never made
a full-fledged game in Java so I thought it would be a good idea for me to also make the game engine.
I am using a tutorial to write this at the moment, and I do not understand everything, but I am glad
that I am writing it as it is my first time using something like this, and it helps me to understand,
to an extent, what is actually going on.
